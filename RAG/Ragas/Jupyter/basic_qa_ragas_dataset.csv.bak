"Compare and contrast Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with R^2AG. In your answer, specifically mention how R^2AG addresses the 'semantic gap' between LLMs and retrievers that exists in traditional RAG approaches.","According to the provided context, here's a comparison of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with R^2AG:

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is mentioned in both documents as a method that leverages external content retrieved from sources like Wikipedia to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks. However, it's noted in one document that RAG has a ""semantic gap"" between LLMs and retrievers due to differences in their training objectives and architectures.

R^2AG, on the other hand, is proposed as an enhanced framework for filling this semantic gap. According to the second document, R^2AG incorporates retrieval information into the generation process by utilizing nuanced features from the retrievers and employing a R^2-Former to capture retrieval information. This allows R^2AG to integrate retrieval information into LLMs' generation using a retrieval-aware prompting strategy.

In contrast to traditional RAG approaches, which are burdened with distinguishing documents provided by retrievers using their inherent knowledge, R^2AG addresses the semantic gap by serving as an anchor that aids LLMs in the generation process. This is achieved through the incorporation of retrieval information into the generation process, thereby filling the semantic gap.

Overall, while traditional RAG approaches rely on LLMs to passively accept and distinguish documents provided by retrievers, R^2AG actively incorporates retrieval information into the generation process, making it a more effective and efficient method for augmenting large language models with external content.","['For example, if several pages of Wikipedia are retrieved as possible relevant\ncontent, the transformation-LLM processes this content and may generate a\nsummary or remove unnecessary information from that original content.'

1School of Computer Science, South China Normal University","The enhanced RAG framework proposed in the paper, R^2AG, addresses the 'semantic gap' between Large Language Models (LLMs) and retrievers by incorporating retrieval information into the generation process. Specifically, it utilizes nuanced features from the retrievers and employs a R^2-Former to capture retrieval information, which is then integrated into LLMs' generation using a retrieval-aware prompting strategy. This approach fills the semantic gap by providing an anchor for LLMs to aid in the generation process, making it more effective, robust, and efficient."
